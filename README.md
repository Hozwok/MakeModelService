MakeModelService
================

A reverse engineering work on AutoScout24 (european marketplace) that use its api to retrieve Make / Model / Version of cars

I always loved to understand how things work.

This is an example of how, not carefully protecting its database, autoscout24 reveals too much through its API.

Feel free to fork and extend this class as as you want.

##Usage
Open the shell, and do `php example.php`
